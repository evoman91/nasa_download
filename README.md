# Overview

Basic downloader for the NASA API.

You will need to change the `search_term` array to include your search terms and `export_root` to set your export location. The files will be downloaded into a year\month\day folder structure based on the media creation date returned in the API response.

The NASA API Documentation can be found [here](https://images.nasa.gov/docs/images.nasa.gov_api_docs.pdf)
